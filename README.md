# triangle-calculator

Please read this file in full.

This repository is for a C++ program that uses logic to find the equation & calculate with the equation to find the requested property of the triangle based off of known properties of the triangle, designed to be as automated as possible.

This program is in beta currently as all feature's are implemented (but more may be added if requested or required), if you find any bugs please report them in the issues section of the repository.  

Downloads:  
Windows 32-bit - Download triangle-calculator-windows10-x86.exe  
Windows 64-bit - Download triangle-calculator-windows10-x86.exe  
Linux 32-bit - Download triangle-calculator-linux-x86  
Linux 64 bit - Download triangle-calculator-linux-x64  
If you don't know what instruction set your computer used download the corresponding x86 file for your OS.

To run:  
Windows will allow you to run the program by double clicking on it as an exe  
Linux will allow you to run the program with ./program_name  

To compile:  
Download triangle-calculator.cpp and then you can compile this given you OS and insturction set  
Windows 32-bit -  
Windows 64-bit -  
Linux 32-bit - g++ -m32 triangle-calculator.cpp -o triangle-calculator-linux-x86  
Linux 64-bit - g++ -m64 triangle-calculator.cpp -o triangle-calculator-linux-x64  

Use:  
When the program load's enter in any known value's for angle's or side's on the triangle as well the side or angle to be calculated. If it is possible based off of that information it will calculate the side or angle specified by working out the equation to use through basic logic and then entering value's into the formula.  
Note - This program currently cannot calculate the value of a side or angle as needed to have the right information to calculate the requested side or angle, this is possible to implement but has not been done yet.
