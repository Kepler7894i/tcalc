# triangle-calculator

Please read this file in full.

This repository is the source code for a c++ program that automatically work's out which equation to use for triangle calculation's and then automatically calculate's the solution based only off known value's of the triangle and no other information, designed to be as automated as possible.

This program is in alpha currently as not all feature's are fully implemented yet, if you find any bugs please report them in the issues section of the repository.  

Install:
For a 32-bit Windows OS download triangle-calculator-windows10-x86.exe
For a 64-bit Windows OS download triangle-calculator-windows10-x86.exe
For a 32-bit Linux OS download triangle-calculator-linux-x86
For a 64-bit Linux OS download triangle-calculator-linux-x64

To run:  
Windows will allow you to run the program by double clicking on it as an exe  
Linux will allow you to run the program with ./program_name  
Hopefully ability to double click and run should be implemented soon.

Pre-compiled prgorams may be outdated so to ensure that you get a fully updated version of the program it is recommended that you compile triangle-calculator.cpp yourself, instructions for how to do this should come soon.

Use:  
When the program load's enter in any known value's for angle's or side's on the triangle as well the side or angle to be calculated. If it is possible based off of that information it will calculate the side or angle specified by working out the equation to use through basic logic and then entering value's into the formula.
Note - This program currently cannot calculate the value of one side or angle if calculating that would mean it would have the right information to calculate the requested side or angle, that is possible to implement but has not been done yet.
