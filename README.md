# triangle-calculator
This repository is the source code for a c++ program that automatically work's out which equation to use for triangle calculation's and then automatically calculate's the solution based only off known value's of the triangle and no other information, designed to be as automated as possible.

When the program load's enter in any known value's for angle's or side's on the triangle as well the side or angle to be calculated. If it is possible based off of that information it will calculate the side or angle specified by working out the equation to use through basic logic and then entering value's into the formula.
Note: It cannot calculate the value of one side or angle if calculating that would mean it would have the right information to calculate the         requested side or angle, that is possible to implement but has not been done yet.

This program is in alpha currently as not all feature's are fully implemented yet.

This shall be updated as the project develop's and so has been created as it's own branch.
